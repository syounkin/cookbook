\freeform This recipe is from Steve Younkin. 
\ing[1]{}{onion, chopped}
\ing[2]{tbsp}{olive oil}
\ing[1]{lb}{ground turkey, preferably turkey breast}
\ing[5]{tbsp}{chili powder (Steve prefers Spice Island)}
Saute the onion and ground turkey in olive oil over medium heat until no pink remains in the meat and the onion is softened. Sprinkle the chili powder over the meat and onion and continue cooking, mixing well to release the chili oil, about 3 minutes.
\ing[\fr34]{c.}{red wine}
\ing[52]{oz}{chopped tomatoes (canned or, as Steve prefers, boxed Pomi brand tomatoes)}
\ing[2]{tsp}{Kosher salt, plus more to taste}
\ing[1-2]{tbsp}{sugar}
\ing[1]{15 oz}{can red kidney beans}
Add red wine and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in chopped tomatoes. Sprinkle half of the salt over top, mixing well. Repeat with the remaining teaspoon of salt. Finally, add the sugar, stir well and simmer for 30-60 minutes, uncovered. Just before serving, adjust seasoning with additional salt, if desired. Drain the canned kidney beans, stirring them into the chili for 2-3 minutes until warmed through. Serve with diced fresh onion, shredded cheddar cheese, corn chips, spaghetti and/or hot dogs.
