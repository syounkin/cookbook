\begin{recipe}{Chili Powder \#10}{about \unit[1]{cup}}{1 hour}
\ing[55]{gr.}{guajillo chiles, dried\\(\unit[2.5--5]{kSc.})}
\ing[14]{gr.}{coste\~{n}o chiles, dried\\(\unit[7--10]{kSc.})}
\ing[10]{gr.}{datil chiles, dried\\(\unit[100--300]{kSc.})}
Stem, slice and seed chiles. Weigh the chiles after stemming and seeding.  Wear latex gloves.
\ing[20]{gr.}{whole cumin seed}
Toast the chiles with the cumin for about \unit[3--4]{minutes} moving constantly on a dry skillet.  Let chile and cumin cool.
%\freeform I used whole dried datil pods bought online Linda Younkin.  I do not know where they came from.  The rest of the chiles were guajillo purchased at a local hispanic grocery.  Guajillo also may be found at Fresh Market.
\ing[1]{tsp}{garlic powder}
Grind chiles and cumin along with garlic powder.
%\ing[1]{tsp}{paprika}
%Grind chiles and cumin along with other spices until a fine powder.
%\freeform The datil chiles used in this recipe were bought dried and shredded from ``Bite Me Farms,'' St. Augustine, FL --- \url{http://joesbitemefarms.com/}. Joe does not remove the seeds before shredding the peppers.  I did my best to avoid seeds and membrame, but surely some made it in to the chili powder.
