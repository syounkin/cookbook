One of Julie's favorites for nice occasions. Adapted from classic Italian appetizers with fresh figs and prosciutto.
\newstep
\ing[12]{oz.}{Prosciutto, thinly sliced}
\ing[8]{oz.}{Parmigiano Reggiano, block}
\ing[\fr12]{c.}{fig jam}
\ing[20-30]{}{chives}
\ing[3]{}{yellow or sweet onions}
Slowly saut\'{e}e the onions in equal parts butter and olive oil --- about 2 tbsp each --- until onions are soft and begin to caramelize. The Parmigiano should be in rough chunks approximately \fr34 inches around. Set out a thin slice of prosciutto, layering a second slice if there are holes or tears in the first. Place a piece of cheese in the middle. On top of the cheese place about a tablespoon of onion, then a teaspoon of fig jam. Gather up the edges of the prosciutto to form a little bundle, squeezing gently at the top around the neck of the bundle. Use one or two chives to tie the neck of the bundle as tightly as possible without breaking the chives.
