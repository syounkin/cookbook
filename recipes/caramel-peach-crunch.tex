\begin{recipe}{Caramel Peach Crunch}{}{}
\freeform  Mmmm\ldots\\ This recipe comes from Linda Younkin and is truly a summertime favorite. It makes an excellent peach pie (just bake in a homemade pie shell, ideally set on a thoroughly preheated baking stone). This recipe also works very well with other fruits such as blueberries or strawberries (to which a few tablespoons of arrowroot or cornstarch should be added to thicken the filling.) Julie likes to make a 1\fr12  times recipe of topping to ensure a hearty layer of caramel crunch.
