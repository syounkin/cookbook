\begin{recipe}{Eddie's Buttermilk Biscuits}{18--20 biscuits}{}
\freeform Eddie Stuart, Julie's maternal grandfather, became a baker after he retired. His homemade croissants made from scratch over a period of nearly two days were his most famous baked goods, but his buttermilk biscuits were a classic for the Buss family (and are much easier to make). Eddie's buttermilk biscuits were served hot out of the oven for breakfast during summers at Lake Geneva. They are excellent with butter and jam or a piece of bacon.\\
