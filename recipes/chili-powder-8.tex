\begin{recipe}{Chili Powder \#8}{\unit[\fr23]{cup}}{1 hour}
\ing[74]{gr.}{guajillo chiles, dried\\(\unit[2.5--5]{kSc.})}
\ing[5]{gr.}{datil chiles, dried\\(\unit[100--300]{kSc.})}
\ing[15]{gr.}{whole cumin seed}
Toast the sliced, stemmed and seeded chiles with the cumin for about \unit[3--4]{minutes} moving constantly.  Let chile and cumin cool.
\freeform I used whole dried datil pods bought online Linda Younkin.  I do not know where they came from.  The rest of the chiles were guajillo purchased at a local hispanic grocery.  Guajillo also may be found at Fresh Market.
\ing[\fr12]{tsp}{garlic powder}
\ing[1]{tbsp}{dried oregano}
Grind chiles and cumin along with garlic powder and oregano.
\freeform For this recipe I used much less garlic powder and oregano than in the past, and no paprika at all.  I hope that the flavor in the datil comes through so I didn't want to overwhelm it with garlic.
%\ing[1]{tsp}{paprika}
%Grind chiles and cumin along with other spices until a fine powder.
%\freeform The datil chiles used in this recipe were bought dried and shredded from ``Bite Me Farms,'' St. Augustine, FL --- \url{http://joesbitemefarms.com/}. Joe does not remove the seeds before shredding the peppers.  I did my best to avoid seeds and membrame, but surely some made it in to the chili powder.
