Boil and salt water for the pasta.

Finely chop the onion and saut\'{e}e in the olive oil and butter until limp over medium heat.

\ing[\fr14]{c.}{fresh thyme}
\ing[\fr14]{c.}{fresh chives}
Finely chop the herbs together and, reducing the heat to medium-low, add to the onions. While the herbs and onion are cooking, boil the pasta, which will only need a few minutes to become tender.
\ing[\fr34]{c.}{heavy cream}
Add the cream to the cooking herbs and onion and let reduce slowly for a few minutes. Drain the pasta and add the pan with the herb cream sauce. Mix to incorporate
Sprinkle with finely grated parmesan cheese and serve immediately.
\freeform Nearly any mixture of fresh herbs will work. We have tried mint, sage, thyme, chives, parsley and others.
