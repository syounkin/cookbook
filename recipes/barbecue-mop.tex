\begin{recipe}{Basic Barbecue Mop}{about 2 cups}{15 minutes}
\freeform Taken from \emph{\path{allrecipes.com}}.
\ing[1]{cup}{apple cider}
\ing[\fr34]{cup}{apple cider vinegar}
\ing[1]{tbsp}{onion powder}
\ing[1]{tbsp}{garlic powder}
\ing[2]{tbsp}{lemon juice}
\ing[1]{}{~o pepper, finely chopped (optional)}
\ing[3]{tbsp}{hot pepper sauce}
\ing{}{kosher salt}
\ing{}{black pepper}
Combine all ingredients and mix.
\freeform We didn't use hot sauce, but we did use the ~o.  We used this mop on pork spare ribs rubbed with the basic rib rub \ref{}.  It was fine -- nothing to get too excited about.  Similar to what we normally used, and is thus the basic rib rub.
