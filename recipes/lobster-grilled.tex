\begin{recipe}{Grilled Lobster}{}{}
\freeform Each year Linda sends us four lobsters for Sam's birthday on
March 2.  We usually boil two and grill two so that all four can be
cooked simultaneously and we can compare the merits of the two
grilling methods.  First we present the recipe for grilling.\\
\ing[2]{}{live lobsters}
Steam, covered, in two inches of water for 3\fr12 minutes to kill
the lobsters so you don't have to chop them in half while they are
still alive.  Remove and let cool until they can be handled, ten to
fifteen minutes.\\
\freeform Cut the lobsters in half straight down the middle from
between the eyes through the tail.  Do not remove any of the yucky
stuff.  Place the four lobster halves shell side down on a hot grill.  Heat is
good, but singed shell is bitter, so avoid a large flame.\\
\ing[4]{tbsp}{butter, melted}
After the lobsters have been on the grill for about five minutes brush
with melted butter.  Cover the grill and cook for another five minutes
or so.\\
\freeform We have found that grilled tails are great, but the claws
are better boiled.  It is also quite awkward to cook both the tail and
claw when on the grill.  Next time we will try grilling the tails
and boiling the claws.
